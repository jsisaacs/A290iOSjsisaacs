1. All parts of the homework are completed.

2. I think it is interesting that the data is persisted so it can be referenced 
   when the app is closed and then opened again.

3. If I made a method named newInstance(), which creates a new instance of an object,
   why can't I just call newInstance() in the playground?  For some reason, this 
   does not work for me.
