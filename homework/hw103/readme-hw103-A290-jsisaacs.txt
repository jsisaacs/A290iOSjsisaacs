I completed all of the parts of the homework 103 EXCEPT the last part where
you have to create 4 new methods for the SecondViewController.swft and the
FlashCardModel.swift.  I figured out how to make getCurrentQuestion, but I 
don't know how to do the set methods.  I attempted them with the notion that
I could just append whatever is in the UITextField to the dictionaries 
questions and answers in the FlashCardModel.swift, but I had a lot of trouble
implementing it.  So My project compiles and runs, but breaks when you click
the 'OK' button in the second view.  

I do have a question about how I would actually finish the homework. I spent
hours googling and trying to find remedies to my issue in the textbook as 
well, but I just couldn't figure it out.

Thanks,
