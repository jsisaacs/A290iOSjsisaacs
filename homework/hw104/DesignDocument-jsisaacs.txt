Design Document 


Main Functionality
User can log cumulative expenses that are tax deductible, export it to a formatted pdf, and visualize expenses in a simple and intuitive dashboard.


Why is the problem important?
The purpose of a tax deduction is to “decrease your taxable income, thus decreasing the amount of tax you owe to the federal government.”  According to H & R Block, over 4 million people don’t claim eligible tax deductions.


What can be deducted?
*  job expenses not reimbursed by employer
   * union dues, uniforms, gas and car repair
*  student loan interest that parents pay
*  self-owned business
   * office equipment, sales tax on business purchases, health insurance premiums
* hybrid car tax credit 
* Charity
* theft and casualty
   * unexpected loss of property from natural disaster, fire
* home mortgage interest
* state and local income or sales tax paid
* personal property tax
* real estate taxes and points 
* gambling losses


There are restrictions on what can be deducted, but the main point to be made is that there are a large number of people that could benefit from logging expenses and this app aims to provide this service.  The user is warned to keep all receipts for verification.
