I observed my app to record how many clicks in sequence were made, touches began, and oddly only 1 touches detected at once.
This is unexpected because I thought it would record clicks with multiple touches.

The four event handlers can be triggered by clicking (touchesBegan), 
moving while clicking (touchesMoved), unclicking (touchesEnded), and stopping
the sequence of clicks (touchesCancelled).

I guess forget the first paragraph it turns out if i hold option I can use 2 fingers.
