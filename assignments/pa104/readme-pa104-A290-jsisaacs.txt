Deduct It!
10/2/2017

I have completed all parts of the assignment and a little extra.

I figured out how to hook up a nav bar button to a segue that reverses the animation - this is used when the 
user is done filling the expense form out and clicks 'done' at the top right of the view.

Task 1:

(1) UITabViewController - 2 Tabs: a dashboard and an expenses tab; parent controller to the other views
(2) Bar Button Item - 5 bar buttons: a PDF button that renders the PDF, a settings button that
    	takes the user to the settings view, a + button in the expense view that takes the user to 
    	the expense form, a cancel button that cancels adding a new expense, and 2 done buttons, 
    	one for the expense form and the other for closing the settings view.
(3) UITableViewController - 3 Table Views: expense list, add expense form, and the settings view
(4) UINavigationController - 4 views that are embedded in a Nav Controller: expense list, add expense form,
		dashboard, and the settings view.
(5) Image View - 2 image views: dashboard graphs are help in the image view as of right now as placeholders,
		 but they will be implemented with the Charts library (https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts).
